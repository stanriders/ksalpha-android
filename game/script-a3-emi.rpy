    mu "On the one hand, there was chemistry, 'cause of all the explosions."

    mu "Never did replace those windows…"

    "Mutou trails off, and frowns slightly."

    mu "Still, I suppose the ban from the chemistry lab was enough."

    "I nod slowly, wondering where this is all going."

    "Mutou snaps back to the present. It's almost like talking with Rin, only Mutou seems to have more of a penchant for explosives."

    mu "So I did a lot of physics too. Still used explosives and such, only that way I didn't have to make 'em myself anymore."

    mu "Then I went back to chemistry, because nobody would make things for me after the damage to the football field."

    hi "What?"

    "Mutou snaps back again."

    mu "Right! Yes! You!"

    hi "Me?"

    mu "Yes! You should look into science!"

    mu "You're fantastic at it."

    mu "Unless you'd rather just go into math or something."

    "Mutou makes a sour face."

    mu "Not a big fan of straight math. Less explosions and firing things out of cannons."

    hi "You're saying I should study science at university?"

    "Mutou seems thrown off balance by my question."

    mu "Well, sort of."

    mu "You could also join the science club!"

    mu "Well, not really. There's not actually a science club."

    mu "But there could be!"

    mu "You could even be a charter member!"

    mu "A founding father!"

    mu "Of course, you'd need to find other members."

    mu "Time. Space. Space-time. Black holes and such."

    mu "And it's not that dense."

    mu "Just to see if that sort of thing's interesting for you, you understand."

    mu "Hang around after class and we can either discuss it or I can show you how to make explosives in the lab."

    mu "Or both."

    "Pushing these thoughts to the back of my mind, I throw on my running clothes and open the door."

    "Emi's waiting for me with her usual smile."

    emi "You're late!"

    emi "Or at least, you're not early today."

    emi "Are you tired or something?"

    "I find myself ruefully rubbing the back of my head."

    hi "Something like that, yeah."

    hi "Lots to think about and all that."

    "Emi giggles at my mild understatement."

    emi "Yeah, I didn't sleep that well either."

    emi "I was actually glad you weren't early, 'cause I wasn't early either."

    "I wonder if the same thing kept us awake."

    "The image of her weeping face passes through my mind."

    hi "What kept you up?"

    "Emi's expression falters, but she quickly notices my curiosity and gives me a forced smile."

    emi "Nothing important."

    "She's obviously not telling me something."

    "The question is, should I press the issue?"

    "Something's clearly been bothering her for a while."

    "I want to help her, but would it just come off as me being nosy?"

    "She's got to know I care about her, though."

    hi "Are you sure?"

    hi "If something's bothering you, I'm here to help you sort it out."

    "Emi laughs then, but it's not her usual laugh. There's an edge to it that seems almost bitter."

    emi "Sort it out?"

    emi "I'm not sure it can be sorted out, Hisao."

    "An almost grim smile crosses her lips."

    "It's like a smile of resignation."

    emi "I don't think you could help me, anyway."
    
    "That hurts."

    "I don't want to say that it hurts to her, but it does."

    "Doesn't she realize I want to be there for her when things go wrong?"

    hi "Well, I won't push you on the matter."

    hi "But I'm here for you if you decide later that you'd like to talk about it."

    hi "It might help."

    "I can see the debate raging behind Emi's eyes."

    "It seems like she wants to tell me, but she's not sure whether or not she can."

    hi "Hey, forget about it for now, okay?"

    hi "We've got running to do."

    "The mention of running, something that she can handle, brings Emi back to her usual self."

    emi "Right!"

    emi "Hurry up and stretch out, Hisao!"

    emi "We've got to get moving!"

    "She takes off like a shot, far quicker than I'm used to."

    "Still, I try to keep pace with her, recklessly testing my limits."

    "It gives me a feeling of freedom, like my heart is no longer important."

    "I find myself wanting to laugh, filled with the feeling of moving beyond what I once called my boundaries."

    "The nurse's warnings to not overdo things echo in my mind, and I disregard them."

    "This feeling I've got—this willingness to risk a heartattack for something so trivial as a morning run, feels out of character for me."

    "But is it?"

    "Or rather, should it be?"

    "I've got a weak heart, sure."

    "It'll never be capable of the sorts of speed and endurance Emi's capable of."

    "Though I probably wouldn't be able to get that good if I head a healthy heart."

    "But this feeling of freedom I'm experiencing right now, isn't that worth a little risk?"
    
    "As we round the final bend, I feel my legs screaming in protest, but for the first time, I ignore them."

    "I accelerate to finish at a sprint, nearly catching up to Emi."

    "That was never going to happen, of course."

    "Still, I feel surprisingly good."

    "Oh sure, my legs feel like they're about to catch fire, and I'm having trouble staying upright."

    "But there's been a shift of some sort today."
    
    "And it's all thanks to the girl grinning at the finish line, waiting for me."
    
    hi "That was a bit faster than usual, don't you think?"

    "My comment is met with a grin and a shrug."

    emi "Can't have you think I was going to go soft on you, now can I?"
    
    emi "But you managed to handle it just fine."

    hi "Well I couldn't have done it without you."
    
    "Still feeling the high from the run, and moved by a surge of gratitude, I seize Emi in a hug."
    
    hi "Thanks."

    hi "Really, I'm not just saying that."

    hi "I'm in your debt."

    "Emi seems flustered by my words, squirming uncomfortably."

    emi "Don't be silly, Hisao."

    emi "Someone had to haul you out here, didn't they?"

    emi "And it's not like you're not doing anything for me, right?"

    emi "I needed a running partner, remember?"

    "I shake my head, still pointedly not letting go of Emi, who stops squirming and merely looks up at me with a quickly deepening blush that almost seems out of character."

    hi "No, that's not true."

    hi "You wanted a running partner, but you didn't need one."

    hi "If I hadn't shown up the day after the festival, you still would have run, right?"

    hi "But it doesn't work the other way around."

    hi "I only managed to make it out a few times before the festival."
    
    hi "And without you…"

    hi "I probably wouldn't have made it out at all after that."

    "Emi smiles at me and prods my chest with one finger."

    emi "You are pretty lazy, Hisao."

    hi "Hey, I was giving you a compliment!"

    emi "Well… you're welcome, I guess."

    hi "I'll pay you back somehow."

    emi "Oh, uh, well…"

    emi "That's not necessary, you know."

    emi "I mean I kinda like you, Hisao."

    emi "And being able to run with you in the mornings isn't exactly a bad deal for me either, so…"
    
    "For someone who gets so much praise, she seems unused to gratitude."

    "I can't think of anything else to say, so we fall silent."

    "Some part in the back of my mind feels the need to inform me of how long we've been standing together."

    "I become aware of Emi's breathing, of the dampness of her clothing, and of the scent of her."

    "Coming off of anyone else, it would stink."

    "Coming off of Emi, it fits her in a way nothing else could."

    "Her skin is cool, slick with sweat, and a breeze causes goosebumps to rise."

    "Almost without thinking about it, I lean down and meet Emi's mouth which has already moved to meet my own."

    "It's an odd thing about kissing Emi."

    "She grins as we kiss, a movement of her mouth against mine that tugs at my own mouth, leaving me no other option but to to grin as well."

    "Today, she giggles."

    "A girlish giggle whose vibrations travel from her mouth to mine."

    "I feel like I could die happily here, now, at this exact moment."

    "But stronger than that feeling is the desire to stay here, stay with her."

    "The kiss ends, and I finally let my arms drop back to my sides."

    "Emi is smiling warmly at me, and giggles again."

    emi "Come on Hisao, we'd better go see the nurse."

    "Then it happens."

    "As she turns to begin walking, she gives out a tiny yelp and stumbles forward."

    hi "Emi!"

    "I leap to steady her, and notice with some concern that she's favoring the same leg as last night."

    hi "Your leg…"

    "Emi seems panicked, and pushes away from me."

    emi "It's fine!"

    "My expression must seem hurt, because she hastens to apologize."

    emi "Sorry! Sorry!"

    emi "Didn't mean to push you like that!"

    emi "I was just…"

    "She stumbles for something to say."

    emi "It's nothing, really."

    hi "Hey, don't worry about it."

    "She's so flustered, I decide to shrug the whole thing off."

    "But there's a cold feeling in the pit of my stomach now that won't go away."

    "I tried to step in and help her, and she pushed me away."

    "Smiling, I shove those thoughts to the back of my mind and concentrate on Emi."

    hi "I just don't want you getting hurt, that's all."

    emi "You don't have to worry about me, honest."

    emi "I'm fine!"

    "Yes, you say that but I don't believe you."

    shi "…"

    shi "…"
    
    mi "In this case, however, ignorance of the law may be your excuse, as we are feeling lenient and the paperwork required to punish the both of you would only add to the already mountainous volume of work which confronts us, the sole members of the student council—and besides, you two are adorable together~!"
    
    shi "…"
    
    mi "Therefore consider this a formal warning, and please refrain from such displays in the future. At least when Shizune can see you, Hicchan~!"
    
    "This whole spiel is so patently ridiculous that I can't help but reply in the same pompous manner."
    
    hi "Well, I for one feel enlightened."
    
    hi "I apologize profusely for my rash actions and will strive to contain my baser impulses which, I fear, impel me toward such inappropriate displays of public affection."
    
    hi "It is hardly my wish to burden an already overworked Student Council with such petty matters, and will do my best to make your lives easier in this matter in the future."
    
    hi "At least, when Shizune's watching."
    
    "This last line is delivered with a wink to Misha, who finally loses control of her laughter."

    "Class is uneventful, and after the final bell rings, I find myself alone with Mutou again."
    
    mu "So, the second meeting of the Science Club!"
    
    mu "Or is it the first?"
    
    mu "What do you think, should we count yesterday as a meeting?"
    
    hi "Well, we did form the club yesterday, didn't we?"
    
    hi "That seems like club business, so we can safely call yesterday a meeting."
    
    "Mutou seems delighted by my response."
    
    mu "Very good!"
    
    mu "Logical thinking! Yes, that's brilliant!"
    
    mu "You really do have a knack for this sort of thing, don't you Hisao?"
    
    hi "I guess so?"
    
    mu "No no no, Hisao."
    
    mu "A scientist speaks with authority."
    
    mu "When the world wants to know how it works, we tell it."
    
    "He grins"
    
    mu "Even if all we've got is a really, really good guess."
    
    mu "But we must sound certain anyway, because we're authorities on the subject, right?"
    
    "This seems to amuse him even more, and he breaks off into a chuckle for a moment before continuing."
    
    mu "That's a complete load of crap, of course."
    
    mu "We know a lot, sure, but nobody's an expert on how the world works."
    
    mu "If only because nobody can be sure."
    
    mu "And with no certainty, there's no experts."
    
    mu "But we like to pretend, sometimes."
    
    hi "And there's some things we can be certain of, right?"
    
    mu "Oh, of course.  We know gravity's there, for example."
    
    "To illustrate, Mutou picks up a pencil and drops it."
    
    mu "See?  Still there."
    
    mu "But it's good to check every once in a while."
    
    mu "That's why you'll still see researchers mucking about with gravity."
    
    mu "We're pretty sure we know how it works, but there's always a chance that something isn't how we think it is."
    
    mu "So you check, and check, and check."
    
    mu "That's science in a nutshell, Hisao."
    
    "The whole time I've listened feeling rather spellbound."
    
    "Mutou seems to really be passionate about this stuff."
    
    "I'll admit, I think I feel some of that passion rubbing off on me."
    
    "How the world works…"
    
    "How humans work."
    
    "How the universe works."
    
    "All these questions to be answered."
    
    "And hell, depending on what I go into, maybe I could even figure out a way to fix my heart."
    
    "Although I don't think that's a real priority for me."
    
    "Besides, as we start discussing the book he gave me yesterday, I find myself more and more interested in that than my heart condition."
    
    "Before we even realize it, an hour's gone by."
    
    mu "Well, let's call this meeting over for now, okay?"
    
    mu "We'll have another meeting…tomorrow, or uh…the day after."
    
    "He considers this for a moment."
    
    mu "Call it the day after."
    
    mu "I've got a lot grading to do."
    
    hi "Okay."
    
    hi "See you then."
    
    "As I exit the classroom, I realize that I don't really have anything to do tonight."

    yu "I'd suspected a thief before, but this proves it!"

    yu "Yeah, like when you're in the dorms, you know."
    
    yu "Keep an eye out for suspicious activity."
    
    "What constitutes suspicious, anyway?"
    
    "I mean Kenji's a pretty suspicious dude, but I'll wager he barely goes to class, much less sneaks into the library to pilfer books."

    "Or maybe because I just want to tell someone about it."
    
    "I mean it's not every day you get a girlfriend."

    yu "I'll bet you two are great together!"

    yu "I met this guy once…"
    
    yu "We got along really great, but it turned out he was younger than me."

    yu "I hope it wasn't something I did…"

    emi "Guess I should've listened to you, Hisao."
    
    emi "My leg's got a nasty infection. I'm not allowed to run on it for at least a couple of weeks."
    
    "She gives a bitter laugh that shouldn't be coming from her."
    
    emi "Heh, I can't even walk on it."
    
    emi "I could have used a crutch and kept one of my legs, but I didn't see the point."
    
    emi "Why hop? You can't run on one leg."
    
    emi "At least this way I can still, I dunno, roll fast or something."
    
    hi "Y-yeah, that's good, right?"
    
    "My awkward attempt to look on the bright side seems appreciated."
    
    "But not really effective."
    
    "Emi shrugs again."
    
    emi "It's just… kind of a nuisance."
    
    emi "I mean, we can't even eat up on the roof now."
    
    emi "No wheelchair access."
    
    hi "Yeah, but that's not a big deal, right?"
    
    hi "I mean we can still eat together, and that's the important thing."
    
    "That lopsided grin again. It hurts to look at."
    
    emi "I suppose so, yeah."
    
    emi "But like I said, it's a nuisance."
    
    emi "I mean, I haven't used a wheelchair extensively in…"

    emi "A long time."

    emi "Oh yeah, of course."

    hi "Er, that is, can I help with anything?"
    
    "Emi shakes her head and there's a bit of her usual grin back."
    
    emi "Nah, I can manage fine by myself."
    
    emi "Although if you want to help me over to my bed, it would save me the trouble of rolling over there myself."

    "Emi hits me with a pillow."
    
    emi "Ass."

    hi "Forget I said anything, okay?"
    
    "I place a hand gingerly around her and pull her close."

    "I can't tell if I'm being mocked or not."
    
    hi "Of course. I mean sure, you're a bit heavy, but—mmph!"
    
    "My witty comment is cut off by the sudden press of Emi's lips on mine."
    
    "I'm caught off guard, and am rewarded by hitting my head on the wall behind her bed."

    "Emi laughs."

    "Heck, it seems that just about every time I push too hard, she dances around the subject."
    
    "Or distracts me by…other means."
    
    "Like a few days ago at lunch, when Rin wasn't around…"
    
    "Heh."
    
    yu "I've done it!"

    hi "Jesus!"

    yu "Oh my god!"
    
    yu "I'm so sorry!  I just got—and I really wasn't—and it's just that—"

    hi "Woah, hey."
    
    "My words seem ineffective."

    yu "And it's a {b}library{/b} and I shouldn't be—"
    
    hi "Easy there, just calm down."
    
    yu "And really I'm setting a bad example, and now I'll get fired because I can't do anything right—"
    
    hi "YUUKO!"
    
    "Shouting seems to work, though I draw the ire of several other students studying in the library."
    
    "Yuuko snaps to attention, like a soldier who's just heard the captain bark an order."
    
    yu "Sorry! Sorry!"
    
    hi "Calm down, it's okay."
    
    hi "You just startled me a little, and that's only because I was daydreaming instead of studying."
    
    hi "So really, you got me back on task."
    
    "This is a complete lie."
    
    "But it seems to work."
    
    "Yuuko takes a deep breath and seems to calm down a little."
    
    "Though she keeps shifting around with a nervous energy that seems awfully familiar."
    
    hi "So, what's got you so excited anyway?"
    
    yu "The Yamaku Cat Burglar!"
    
    "To her credit, Yuuko manages to convey her intense excitement in a whisper."
    
    yu "I think I know who it is!"
    
    yu "I got an anonymous tip as to their identity!"
    
    yu "So I did some spying, and I think the tipster was right!"
    
    hi "Oh really? And who was this er, burglar?"
    
    "Yuuko shuts her mouth, shaking her head decisively."
    
    yu "Nope, I can't tell you that."
    
    hi "Why not?"
    
    yu "It's between me and the burglar."
    
    yu "I can't risk you warning him that I'm on to his game."
    
    yu "He could tip his hand early, blow town."
    
    yu "Then I'm left with no perp."
    
    "When did Yuuko start talking like a hard-boiled detective?"
    
    hi "I wouldn't warn them!  Why would I care?"
    
    yu "If you've got to ask that question, then you don't need to know."
    
    hi "That doesn't make any sense, but okay."
    
    hi "Congratulations, I guess?"
    
    yu "Thanks!"
    
    yu "Uh, what for?"
    
    hi "The uh, cat burglar thing?"
    
    "Yuuko nods and smiles appreciatively."
    
    yu "So!  Studying for exams?"
    
    hi "Well, that was the plan."
    
    hi "I'm not having much luck, though."
    
    yu "Really?  Is it because you can't find a book?"
    
    yu "I'm really sorry!"
    
    yu "I've been meaning to clean the shelves up for weeks now, but I keep getting distracted!"
    
    yu "I'm so sorry!"
    
    hi "Woah, wait."
    
    hi "It's not that."
    
    hi "I've got my book right here."
    
    "To illustrate the point, and hopefully calm Yuuko down, I indicate the textbook in front of me."
    
    hi "My mind just keeps wandering, is all."
    
    yu "Is it because of the noise in here?"
    
    yu "I'm trying to be more strict about the noise levels, but I can't bring myself to yell at people…"
    
    yu "I mean aren't their lives hard enough without me throwing my authority around?"
    
    hi "No, it's not the noise level either, I promise."
    
    hi "I'm just…"
    
    "Hell, I don't know."
    
    "Worried about Emi."
    
    "Worried about {b}us{/b}."
    
    "Worried about what happens after we graduate."

    yu "What do you mean?"
    
    hi "Well, you know how we're dating now?"
    
    yu "I'd heard.  I think."
    
    hi "I just don't know that we're actually, you know…"
    
    hi "A couple.  Or at least I don't know that we're beyond friends."
    
    "Though friends normally don't do the sorts of things we do."
    
    "Physically we're a couple."
    
    "Coupling, at least."
    
    hi "It's like every time I try to find out more about her, or about what she wants to do with her life, she dodges the question."
    
    hi "Like the other day, I was talking to her at lunch about some schools I've been looking into."
    
    hi "And I asked her, “Have you looked into any schools lately?”"
    
    hi "She shrugs in response, says no, and when I ask why not she says that she doesn't think that far ahead."
    
    hi "I asked why she had that policy, and she…"
    
    "Whoops."
    
    "I suddenly realize what I'm about to start describing, and wisely decide to clam up."
    
    yu "She what?"
    
    hi "Er, she changed the subject."
    
    hi "Wouldn't talk about it."
    
    yu "Maybe it's an uncomfortable subject for her?"
    
    yu "Or she just doesn't think it needs explaining."
    
    hi "Yeah, but it's not just that."
    
    hi "Every time I try to find out what's been bothering her, she changes the subject too."
    
    hi "It's like she likes being with me, but not getting close to me."
    
    "Now that I've said it out loud, I feel worse."
    
    "Yuuko digests this bit of information."
    
    yu "You know, it seems to me that you're more serious about this than she is."
    
    "I can almost feel my stomach twist into a knot."
    
    "She's right."
    
    "That's exactly what it seems like."
    
    hi "But is that really what's going on?"
    
    hi "I mean…"
    
    yu "Sorry!  I'm just talking nonsense!"
    
    yu "You shouldn't take my advice, you barely know me!"
    
    yu "I'm just the librarian, and I'm single so you know I can't know what I'm talking about!"
    
    hi "No, I think…"
    
    hi "I think you have a point."
    
    "As much as it hurts to even consider it."
    
    "Yuuko seems to try desperately to find a way to soften the blow somewhat."
    
    yu "Er, look."
    
    yu "I'm probably wrong, but if you want to be sure of how obviously wrong I am, maybe you should just talk to her?"
    
    yu "Get some time alone and just ask about it."
    
    yu "And don't let her change the subject, either!"
    
    hi "Yeah, maybe I should do that."
    
    "Or maybe I should just enjoy what I have."
    
    "We have fun hanging out, after all."
    
    "And the runs are nice, and the other activities are nice, and talking to her is nice…"
    
    "Do I really need to get closer to her?"
    
    "What I've got right now is pretty good."
    
    "But that's silly."
    
    "I {b}want{/b} to get closer to her."
    
    "I want to be able to help her out with whatever is bothering her."
    
    "But…maybe I should wait until after exams are over."
    
    "Maybe she'll brighten up once the stress has passed."
    
    "If she has, then I don't need to worry about it anymore."
    
    "But if she hasn't, well."
    
    "I'll cross that bridge when I come to it."
    
    "I thank Yuuko for her advice and head back to my room."
    
    "Maybe I'll be able to concentrate more on my studies in there."

    hi "I want you to be happy, you know?"
    
    "I get the feeling that came out wrong, because Emi fixes me with an icy stare."

    emi "I said we're here."
    
    "Emi grabs my hand and we hop off the bus. Emi starts heading down the street almost immediately."
    
    emi "Come on, we've got a couple blocks until my place."
    
    hi "What? Oh, okay."
    
    "I follow Emi down the street, watching her confident stride."
    
    "She's setting kind of a quick pace for just a walk. I guess she's anxious to get there."
    
    hi "So does your mom do this sort of thing often?"
    
    emi "Nah, not too frequently. Mom's never been much for playing hostess."
    
    hi "Oh yeah?"
    
    emi "Yeah, my dad was always the one pushing her to have people over."
    
    "This sudden and unprompted reference to her father catches me off guard."
    
    "And from the look on Emi's face, I'm not sure she meant to mention him. I don't think I've ever heard her talk about him."
    
    "All I remember is that Emi's mom told me that he wasn't around anymore."
    
    hi "Oh? Your mom prefers solitude?"
    
    "Emi laughs, then. It's either from relief that I didn't ask about her father or from finding my statement actually funny."
    
    emi "Not at all! She's why I'm such an outgoing person, you know."
    
    emi "She just prefers to be a guest rather than a hostess. Less stressful that way, or so she says."
    
    hi "Clearly she's never had to meet her girlfriend's mother for dinner."
    
    "Emi giggles again, and speaks in a teasing tone."
    
    emi "Nervous, Hisao?"
    
    emi "You shouldn't be, you know! It's not that big of a deal! Just dinner at my house, that's all!"
    
    hi "Yeah, but have you ever brought home a boyfriend before?"
    
    "I confess that part of me dreads hearing the answer to this."
    
    "I know very little of Emi's past relationships—I don't even know if there {b}were{/b} past relationships."
    
    emi "No, I guess I haven't."
    
    "She frowns worriedly."
    
    emi "Hey, maybe this really is kind of a big deal after all…"
    
    hi "Oh good, now I feel twice as nervous."
    
    "Though to tell the truth I'm pretty happy to hear that I'm the first one."
    
    "Maybe we've got something special after all."
    
    "Bolstered by this new thought, I've managed to calm down considerably by the time Emi knocks on her front door."
    
    emi "Hey, open up mom! We're here!"
    
    "The door swings open and Mrs. Ibarazaki stands grinning at her daughter. The grin is still surprisingly similar to her daughter's."
    
    "I'm never going to get used to that."
    
    emm "You know, people normally wait for a few minutes before they start shouting at the door."
    
    emi "And most mothers say hello to their daughters instead of scolding them right away."
    
    emm "Ah, of course. Welcome home, dear, I've missed you."
    
    "An affectionate hug later we're inside the door, and it is only then that Emi's mom seems to remember that I'm here at all."
    
    emm "And hello to you too, Hisao. How are you?"
    
    hi "I'm quite well, thank you. Nice to not have school to worry about for a little bit."
    
    emm "Ah yes, you've finished up your exams, haven't you? That must be quite a relief for you both."
    
    hi "It's certainly a weight off of my mind, that's for sure."
    
    emi "Mine too!  I think I slept well for the first time in weeks last night from relief alone."
    
    "If this news is a surprise to Emi's mother, she doesn't show it. Still, her response betrays a note of interest."
    
    emm "Is that so?  I'm very glad to hear that, Emi. You know I get worried when you get all wound up about… well, exams."
    
    "Hmm. Certainly Emi's mother knows something I don't—or rather, she doesn't know that Emi's told me about the nightmares."
    
    "It's interesting, being able to observe how Mrs. Ibarazaki covers for Emi. That protective instinct to make sure that I don't know any more than Emi's willing to tell me."
    
    #once again, see this only if you talked to Mutou
    
    "I suppose Emi's got more in common with quarks than I ever realized."
    
    "Moves around fast, impossible to understand through direct observation, yet she has an effect on everyone she encounters."
    
    #okay back to everything else
    
    "I wonder if Emi will indicate that I know about the nightmares. Or does she just keep everything secret from everybody?"
    
    emi "Yeah, it's not been as bad this year as it usually was. Hisao's helped to keep me focused."
    
    "Okay, I know that's not true. She even cut off contact outside of school hours during exam week!"
    
    "But… she did see me during the day. And she told me more than once that the morning run was the only thing she looked forward to during exams, so maybe it's not that unlikely."
    
    "Either way, to hear that being around has helped even a little makes me feel a bit better."
    
    "Emi's mother raises an eyebrow at this statement. Either she doesn't believe Emi, or she's as surprised as I am by her statement."
    
    emm "Well, then it appears that it's a good thing you two have become so close."
    
    emm "I'd tell you to take good care of my daughter, Hisao, but it looks like you're already doing that."
    
    "Emi grins at this and seems to take pride in my having managed to ingratiate myself with her mother so easily."
    
    hi "Actually, I'd say your daughter's been the one taking care of me. She's gotten me out and running."
    
    hi "I've probably been more active since meeting her than I ever was, even before…"
    
    "I'd actually never thought of that much before. Nor had I ever appreciated the humor in it."
    
    "I wasn't too active before the heart attack. Pickup games of soccer don't count; it's not like I did them often."
    
    "So now that I know for sure that I have a weak heart, {b}now{/b} I run every day, pushing my luck with the help of my medication."
    
    "I chuckle quietly, then realize that I never finished my sentence."
    
    hi "Well, before I had my heart attack and wound up at school here."
    
    "It comes out so casually. There was a time that I would have thought twice about talking about what was wrong with me at all."
    
    "But now? Now it just seems silly to care. Especially in the company of Emi and her mother."
    
    "If Emi can be cavalier about her disability, then so can I. I think back to the track meet, where Emi declared herself the fastest thing on no legs."
    
    "The fact of her obvious loss has never seemed to bother her, at least not in public."
    
    "Being stuck in the wheelchair had frustrated her, I know, but even that was something she'd dealt with on her own."
    
    "Despite my efforts to the contrary."
    
    emm "Emi has a way of bringing out the more active side in people. I've never quite figured out how she does it."
    
    "Those puppy dog eyes she gets, for starters."
    
    emm "I'm not surprised that she managed to rope you in to an exercise routine."
    
    emm "If Rin weren't just as stubborn as she is, I'm sure that Emi would have gotten her out and running with you too."
    
    emi "Oh, that reminds me!  Rin says hello."
    
    "I drift to the outer edges of the conversation again as we move into the dining room to eat."
    
    "It smells delicious in here, and the spread that Emi's mom has produced is impressive."
    
    emi "Woah, you've made enough to feed an army in here!"
    
    emm "Is it too much? Well, you can always take some leftovers with you when you go."
    
    hi "That sounds great! I can only handle cafeteria food for so long. Something home-cooked would be a welcome change of pace."
    
    emi "What he said. Thanks, mom."
    
    "The food tastes as good as it smells, and there's a lull in the conversation while we all dig in."
    
    "Emi assaults her plate with the usual amount of gusto, and I will admit that I set a pretty fast pace myself."
    
    emm "So Hisao, I hear that you and my daughter here have gotten rather close, hmm?"
    
    "The urge to say something like “Not really” is so strong that I open my mouth to say it, but then reassert control."
    
    "We are close, there's no getting around it. I mean Emi's brought me here, hasn't she?"
    
    "Fortunately, both Emi and her mother seem to take my reaction as a sign that I'm caught off guard rather than considering saying something cruel."
    
    hi "Heh, I suppose we have. I blame the morning runs, myself."
    
    emi "You make it sound like a bad thing, Hisao."
    
    emm "Well I for one found it a relief."
    
    hi "Why's that?"
    
    emm "Emi's always been a popular girl, but never made many close friends.  Especially not with a boy."
    
    "This is a bit of news to me. I've always seen Emi chatting with her classmates in the hallways."
    
    "And certainly the whole track team seems to love her, but it is true that she chooses to isolate herself during lunch with Rin and I."
    
    "Not exactly the sort of behavior one expects from a popular girl, after all. Then again, I've experienced her unwillingness to get close first-hand, so I can't say I'm that surprised."
    
    emm "I was beginning to have my doubts."
    
    "Emi rolls her eyes to the ceiling, and grumbles something I can't quite make out."
    
    emi "Oh sure, that one time in the art room and she gets doubts…"
    
    hi "Huh?"
    
    emi "What?"
    
    hi "What's that you just said?"
    
    emi "Nothing."
    
    "Was she joking just now? From the grin on her face, I'm inclined to say she was."
    
    "Mrs. Ibarazaki certainly seems to think so, as she chokes on her drink with laughter."
    
    emm "You've been hanging out with the nurse too long, Emi."
    
    emm "I'm going to have to talk to him about corrupting my daughter."
    
    hi "Somehow I don't think that would be very effective."
    
    emi "I learned most of it from you anyway. Not the nurse."
    
    emm "Don't listen to her, Hisao. She's a born liar."
    
    emi "Hmph. Yeah right."
    
    hi "Oh, I don't know Emi, I think your mother has a point."
    
    emi "What? You traitor! You're supposed to take my side in this!"
    
    hi "Yeah, but you did lie about your leg after the meet—ow!"
    
    "A kick in the shins from an unmistakably plastic foot cuts me off, but not before Mrs. Ibarazaki's eyebrows shoot upwards."
    
    emm "What about your leg?"
    
    emi "It wasn't a big deal, that's all… I just was, er, inawheelchairforabit."
    
    "The last few mumbled words are quickly deciphered (I suspect Emi's mother has experience with this sort of thing) and a worried frown appears on her face."
    
    #As a slight directing note, I would imagine Emi shifting around uncomfortably a lot for the entirety of this exchange, right up to her sudden outburst.
    
    emm "Oh Emi… I know how much you hate being in a wheelchair."
    
    emm "No wonder you've been in such a mood lately!"
    
    hi "Yeah, she's much happier on her feet, so to speak."
    
    emm "Well of course! She spent enough time in a chair just after the accident."
    
    hi "She didn't get prosthetics immediately?"
    
    emm "No, she had to finish healing up before they'd let her start the sort of therapy you've got to go through to adjust to those things."
    
    emm "Especially since she wanted to run on them."
    
    hi "I had no idea."

    #this would be the outburst.
    
    emi "Yeah it sucked. Oh, did you see Rin's mural at the festival?"
    
    "Emi's sudden change of topic makes me realize belatedly that she'd been fidgeting the whole time her mother and I had been talking."
    
    "I should have figured on her being a little skittish when it comes to talking about the accident. Even around her mother."
    
    emm "No, I didn't make it out to the festival, remember?"
    
    emm "Although I caught a glimpse of it at your track meet. It seemed pretty weird to me."
    
    emi "I think that's more or less what she was going for. She talked a lot about it being dreamlike. Or trying to make it dreamlike."
    
    emm "Rin's art is one of those things I don't think I'll ever understand."
    
    emi "That's not suprising. I don't think Rin expects to be understood."
    
    emi "She told me once that art allows people to understand stuff they wouldn't understand otherwise, but all the same she doesn't think it actually works that way."
    
    "I'm actually surprised that Emi's talked about this with Rin extensively enough to actually have Rin's opinion, such as it is."
    
    "But I probably expect that Rin could not, if she were so inclined, do the same thing to Emi."
    
    "Unless, of course, Emi is only keeping me in the dark about everything. Which is likely, but unpleasant to think about."
    
    "I drift down this unpleasant train of thought for a while, losing track of the conversation."
    
    emm "Hey Emi, I've been meaning to ask…"
    
    emi "Huh?"
    
    emm "Are you going to visit your father this year?"
    
    "From the way she says it, you'd think Emi's mother was talking about the weather. From the way Emi reacts, it's clearly not the weather they're talking about."
    
    "She flinches, a slight jerk of the head backwards as if she's just been slapped in the face."
    
    emi "Can we talk about this later?"
    
    "Her voice sounds brittle, strained.  It looks as if she's been severely shaken by the question."
    
    "It seems that Mrs. Ibarazaki misjudged just how close Emi and I are."
    
    "Some things, it seems, are best not conversed about with me around. Her father is one of these things."
    
    "The accident that took her legs is probably another one of those things, if her reaction to the earlier conversation between her mother and myself is any indication."
    
    "It doesn't take Emi's mother long to realize she's screwed up."
    
    emm "Of course we can, dear. I'm sorry to bring it up, I just wanted to ask again so I could make plans—"
    
    emi "It's fine. Don't worry about it."
    
    "Emi fidgets nervously, as if embarrassed by her own reaction. I confess that her reaction is confusing."
    
    "She only just mentioned her father to me earlier today! Less than a few hours ago, even!"
    
    "Why does a simple question about when she'll visit her father cause such a strong reaction?"
    
    "Unless whatever serenity she claimed to have reached by means of our talk the previous evening has suddenly evaporated."
    
    "Or it didn't help as much as she thought. Or claimed."
    
    emi "I'll uh, be right back. Gotta visit the little girl's room."
    
    "Emi gets up suddenly and leaves the table, leaving me and Mrs. Ibarazaki alone."

    emm "Look, there's something you absolutely must understand about the way Emi thinks about the accident."
    
    hi "What's that?"
    
    emm "It wasn't a big deal."
    
    "Somehow I manage to keep my mouth from falling open in surprise, but it takes some effort."
    
    "That has to be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard."
    
    hi "I beg your pardon?"
    
    emm "Okay, maybe it's not that simple, but it's a pretty accurate summation. Emi believes that the accident did not define her—everything she lost that day, that didn't define her either."
    
    emm "She's not “that girl who lost her legs,” she's “The Fastest Thing on No Legs.” Her optimism and energy came out of that wreck without a scratch, as far as she's concerned."
    
    hi "But it goes beyond that, doesn't it? I mean, last night she told me that she refused to rely on me because it would make losing me too painful."
    
    emm "Not really. You said she won't tell you about the accident, even though you've asked her about it before."
    
    emm "The reason she won't talk about it when you ask is because to her it's not something you absolutely need to know. Even if she wasn't terrified of getting too close to you, she still wouldn't talk about it."
    
    hi "But she is afraid of being close to me?"
    
    emm "Oh goodness me, yes. For all that talk about being unscathed by the accident, she's gained the ugly knowledge of how quickly it can all be over."
    
    emm "So she's not going to let people get especially close to her, and she certainly would resent any implication that she cannot work through this on her own."
    
    hi "But I don't think she {b}can{/b}."
    
    emm "Oh no? Are you sure you've been dating my daughter and not somebody else? Trust me Hisao, she could get through it on her own."
    
    hi "But she has nightmares, and can't sleep well, and—"
    
    emm "And she does this every year. Tell me, if she wasn't able to get through it on her own, do you really think she'd still be alive? She would've killed herself or something equally melodramatic."
    
    hi "So what, I shouldn't try to help her?"
    
    emm "I didn't say that! I hate seeing my daughter like this, and knowing that she could rely on someone at school would let me relax."
    
    emm "You just need to understand that accepting help goes against everything Emi thinks about herself and the way the world works."
    
    emm "If you still want to offer her help, then I guess that's your call.  I'd like you to myself, but I'd be silly not to warn you that it's not going to be easy."
    
    emm "You need to be patient with her. She's already closer to you than anyone else she's ever met at Yamaku."
    
    hi "Well it sure doesn't feel like we're very close."
    
    emi "Good, that makes this part easier."
    
    "Emi's voice nearly gives me a heart attack."
    
    hi "Woah! Didn't hear you come back, Emi."
    
    emi "How convenient."
    
    hi "Wait, were you eavesdropping?"
    
    emi "Nope.  Just happened to come downstairs at the right moment, I guess."
    
    emm "Emi, Hisao was just—"
    
    "Emi holds up a finger, cutting her mother off."
    
    emi "On his way out of the house? Yeah, I know."
    
    "Emi's trembling with anger now, looking vaguely betrayed."
    
    emm "Emi, don't be ridiculous, we were just—"
    
    emi "You {b}promised{/b}!"
    
    "The hurt carried in that last word is almost too much for me to bear. The idea that I could hurt her that much is like being kicked in the gut."
    
    "Emi's mother looks similarly pained by the thought."
    
    emm "And I kept that promise! Just listen, there's no reason to go throwing people out of the house."
    
    "Emi's mother seems to be both angry at her daughter's outburst and embarrassed that I'm a witness to it."
    
    "There's only one real solution to this problem, I think."
    
    hi "It's okay. I'll go."
    
    emm "Now really, that seems a little unnecessary…"
    
    hi "Don't worry about it. Thank you for dinner, Mrs. Ibarazaki. And for the advice."
    
    emm "It was my pleasure, Hisao. I'm sorry we didn't get to dessert."
    
    hi "That's okay. I have to watch what I eat anyway."
    
    "The formality of our conversation, coupled with the fact that I'm getting ready to leave, seems to snap Emi out of her anger."
    
    emi "No, wait. I'm sorry, I've been so… and after last night I just thought… You don't have to go, I take it back, it's okay—"
    
    "I can't help but smile slightly. She can barely articulate her apology, and I really would like to stay…"
    
    "But I don't think I can, right now. I need to think about what her mother said. About what I'm going to do about us."
    
    "And in her current state, I don't want to accidentally get Emi angry again either."
    
    hi "No, I think I'd better leave. You seem pretty shook up, and, well, I'd only wind up trying to help you again."
    
    hi "And I know you'd prefer I didn't, so I'm going to leave instead."
    
    emi "But—"
    
    hi "Hey, it's not a problem. You don't want a knight on a white charger, right? Just promise me one thing, okay?"
    
    emi "What?"
    
    hi "Don't be angry at your mom, okay? She was just giving me some advice, that's all."
    
    "Emi nods, hesitantly, like this simple idea is all that she can grab on to at this point. She's so terribly off-balance, but I can't do anything about that right now."
    
    emi "Okay."
    
    hi "See you tomorrow, okay? Running in the morning. Don't forget!"
    
    "I can see that I've hurt Emi by deciding to leave. But there's nothing I can do for her as things stand."
    
    "And I know that she's too stubborn to admit that she wants me to stick around."
    
    "I watch various emotions cross Emi's face as she tries to process everything that's just happened."
    
    "But then comes that calm look again, like last night. And that voice that tries so hard to sound careless."
    
    emi "Sure, Hisao. See you around."
    
    "Both of us are now unwilling to concede emotion at this point, and I'm having a hard time keeping up my facade, so I turn on my heel and walk out the door."
    
    "I shut it behind me slowly, pausing for a moment as the latch catches, my hand on the doorknob."
    
    "Did I make the right decision just now? Should I have stayed and tried to work things out now?"
    
    "No, I decide. Not in front of her mother like that. In spite of everything, I'd rather keep Emi's mother insulated from the sort of anger that surfaced last night."
    
    "Even though she's probably used to it, some protective instinct wants me to keep Emi's image as a cheerful girl intact."
    
    "With a start I realize my hand is still resting on the knob. I take my hand away, put it in my pocket, and head down the slowly darkening street."
